Objective 1: Analysis of Ideal Window Size
From the code i make to analyze and implement the sliding window and assessment logic, the output is in the "analysis_dump_3x3.csv" file

Findings from 3x3 Analysis:
The 3x3 window was successful in detecting the line segment. However, because the drawn line was ~4 pixels thick (thicker than the 3-pixel window), it did not identify the line as a single object.

Instead, it fragmented the line into several different patterns:

A "middle" pattern.

A "top edge" pattern.

A "bottom edge" pattern.

"End-cap" patterns (from the blue dots).

Conclusion on Ideal Size
While a 3x3 window works, it is not ideal for this specific segment.

Pro: It is excellent at finding fine-grained details, such as the exact edges and corners of the line.

Con: It is inefficient. To detect one simple horizontal line, we must create a detector that looks for 5-10 different patterns (as shown in Objective 2).

A more "ideal" window size would be 5x5. A 5x5 window would be large enough to capture the entire 4-pixel thickness of the line in a single pass. This would allow for a much simpler detector that only needs to find one or two primary patterns instead of a large collection of "edge" patterns.



Objective 2: Report of Fitting Window Patterns (3x3)
Based on the analysis_dump_3x3.csv file, the following patterns were identified as "appropriate window patterns" for the drawn horizontal segment. The patterns are represented by their 9-digit string (1 = segment, 0 = background) and a visual grid.

The most frequent patterns are the most "ideal" for detection.

1. Primary Pattern: Middle of Segment
This was the most frequent pattern (231 instances in the CSV). It represents the solid center of the thick line.

Pattern String: 111111111

2. Edge Patterns
These patterns were the next most common, representing the top and bottom edges of the line.

Pattern: Top Edge (Example 1) Pattern String: 111111000

Pattern: Top Edge (Example 2) Pattern String: 111000000

Pattern: Bottom Edge (Example) (Note: The CSV shows this as 111111, which is read as an integer. This is assumed to be 000111111 after a 9-digit string conversion) Pattern String: 000111111

000

3. End-Cap / Corner Patterns
These patterns were less frequent and represent the ends of the line, where the red line meets the blue dots.

Pattern: End Cap (Example 1) Pattern String: 110111111

110
111

Pattern: End Cap (Example 2) Pattern String: 111111110
